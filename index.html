        <h2>Requirements Specification Document</h2>
      </header>
      <main>
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <h4>1.1 Purpose of Document</h4>
        <p>
          This is a Requirements Specific document for a new stand alone league
          of legends fantasy league website for members of the Scuffed Skeleton
          discord community. The Scuffed Skeleton discord ,(the 'SSD'), is a
          communal zone for fans of league of legends to discuss all things lol,
          though primarily LCS/LEC offseason transfers. The fantasy league
          website will provide a new form of participation for active members
          where they can join a league, select their fantasy LCS roster and
          compete to earn the most points over the LCS season. This document
          will describe the scope and objectives of the web-app whilst the goal
          is fairly straight forward and needs no further explanation. This
          document should also model the functional requirements with use cases,
          interaction diagrams, and class models.This document is intended to
          direct the design and implementation of the target system in an object
          oriented language.
        </p>
        <h4>1.2 Background</h4>
        <p>
          The SSD is one of the largest communities relating to professional
          League of Legends. Activity on the discord is significantly higher
          during the transfer period as it is one of the largest platforms where
          rumours relating to player transfers is first revealed. Whilst there
          has been increased activity during the LCS regular season, adding
          another level of interactivity and reason for participation would
          increase community size when the discord is at it's quietest. There
          are currently few websites that allow fantasy leagues for LoL and the
          systems those websites employ are arguably more convoluted than is
          necessary. That means there is suitable demand for this project to be
          created. The functional requirements of this project require skills
          that I feel would suit my portfolio and so whilst this is a passion
          project for me, I hope that it can provide lense through which to
          showcase my ability.
        </p>
        <h4>1.3 Project Scope</h4>
        <p>
          The scope of this prokect is a web-based system that allows users to
          participate in a fantasy league. This will include the implimentation
          of a database system to manage user account details, login system and
          team information. The website will be made from scratch, so this
          project will include the full design of webpages, UI, and webpage
          functionality using JS and React. Issues of website security, other
          than password protection within the site, are not part of this
          project. (!!!CHECK!!!)
        </p>
        <h4>1.4 System Purpose</h4>
        <h4>1.4.1 Location</h4>
        <p>The primary responsibilities of the new system include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>allow users to join the SSD fantasy league</li>
          <li>allow users to create their own fantasy team</li>
          <li>
            to allow users to earn points for their fantasy team and see how
            they line up in relation to other members of the league
          </li>
          <li>allow users who have not logged in to view the leaderboard</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Optional responsibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            allowing visitors to view certain stats of LCS pros and see how they
            have earned points throughout the season
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.4.3 Need</h4>
        <p>
          This project provides the opportunity for me to practice building a
          complete website, both front-end and back-end, whilst also providing a
          gap in the eSport fandom market as current LoL fantasy websites do not
          create the most enjoyable experiences.
        </p>
        <h4>1.5 Overview of Document</h4>
        <p>
          The rest of this document gives the detailed specifications for the
          new sales system. It is organized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Section 2: Functional Objectives Each objective gives a desired
            behavior for the system and a measure to determine if the final
            system has successfully met the objective. These objectives are
            organized by priority. In order for the new system to be considered
            successful, all high priority objectives must be met.
          </li>
          <li>
            Section 3: Non-Functional Objectives This section is organized by
            category. Each objective specifies a technical requirement or
            constraint on the overall characteristics of the system. Each
            objective is measurable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Section 4: Use Case Model The specific behavioral requirements of
            the system are detailed in a series of use cases. Each use case
            accomplishes a user task and shows the interaction between the
            system and some outside actor. Each use case is described with both
            text and an interaction diagram. An interface prototype is also
            shown. The system use case diagram depicts the interactions between
            all use cases and system actors.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Functional Objectives</h3>
        <h4>2.1 High Priority</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The system allows the user to join, interact and view information
            about the SSD fantasy league. The process should be fast and easily
            accessible, with navigation of the website being clear to most
            users.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system should reflect new data that is provided by the
            Leaguepedia api / and or real time data from LCS matches within x
            minutes of the database being updated. This should be seen from
            score updates through all facets of the system, from player scores,
            to fantasy user scores, to the leaderboard rankings.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system should immediately reflect new changes brought about by
            user interaction. This would include signing up to the website or
            the league and making changes to your fantasy team.
          </li>
          <li>
            The website must interact with the database set up for incoming
            leaguepedia data, user login data, user team data and fantasy point
            system.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>2.2 Medium Priority</h4>
        <h4>2.3 Low Priority</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1. Allow user customisability in their team name and profile image.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>3. Non-Functional Objectives</h3>
        <h4>3.1 Usability</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A user should be able to navigate the website with ease, with it
            being obvious what each part of the website does.
          </li>
          <li>
            A user should be able to join leagues, view stats and select players
            for their fantasy team with ease.
          </li>
          <li>
            There should be minimal complexity to the layout and structure of
            the website, with clicks and redirects being as minimal as possible.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. The Use Case Model</h3>
        <h4>4.1 Use Case Descriptions (for selected cases)</h4>
        <h4>Login User</h4>
        <p>
          In order to access sensitive data like linked accounts (email used to
          sign up), to change password, to change fantasy team, a user must
          login so that the system can verify his identity.
        </p>
        <p>Basic Flow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The use case starts when a user indicates that he wants to login.
          </li>
          <li>The system requests the username and password.</li>
          <li>The user enters his username and password.</li>
          <li>
            The system verifies the username and password against all registered
            users.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system starts a login session and displays a welcome message
            based on the user's preferences.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternative Flow:</p>
        <p>Step 4: if username is invalid, the use case goes back to step 2.</p>
        <p>
          Step 4: if the password is invalid the system requests that the user
          re-enter the password. When the user enters another password the use
          case continues with step 4 using the original username and new
          password.
        </p>
        <p>Preconditions:</p>
        <p>The user is registered.</p>
        <p>Postconditions:</p>
        <p>
          The user can now make changes to his own profile and fantasy team or
          join / quit the league.
        </p>
        <h4>Register User</h4>
        <p>
          In order to create/personalise an account, sign up to the league and
          create a fantasy team a new user must register a username and password
        </p>
        <p>Basic Flow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The use case starts when a user indicates that they want to
            register.
          </li>
          <li>The system requests a username and password.</li>
          <li>The user enters a username and password.</li>
          <li>
            The system checks that the username does not duplicate any existing
            registered usernames.
          </li>
          <li>The system requests an email address.</li>
          <li>The user enters the information.</li>
          <li>
            The system checks the user's credentials and stores all user
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system starts a login session and displays a welcome message
            based on the user's preferences.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternative Flow:</p>
        <p>
          Step 4: If the username duplicates an existing username the system
          displays a message and the use case goes back to step 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 5: If the user does not enter a required field, a message is
          displayed and the use case repeats step 4.
        </p>
        <p>Preconditions:</p>
        <p>none</p>
        <p>Postconditions</p>
        <p>
          The user can now personalise their profile, join/quit leagues, and
          create/alter their fantasy team.
        </p>
        <h4>Join League</h4>
        <p>
          In order to join a league and begin working on their fantasy team, a
          user must click on the join league button.
        </p>
        <p>Basic Flow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The use case starts when a user indicates that they want to join the
            fantasy league.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system checks that the user does not already have a fantasy team
            in the league.
          </li>
          <li>The system requests a team name.</li>
          <li>The user enters a team name.</li>
          <li>
            The system checks that the team name does not duplicate any existing
            registered team names and stores all the team information.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system allows the user to access the team creation / management
            panel.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternative Flow:</p>
        <p>
          Step 2. If the user already has a team registered in the league the
          system displays a message and the use case goes back to step 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 5. If the system finds a registered team with the same name it
          will display a message and the use case will go back to step 3.
        </p>
        <p>Preconditions:</p>
        <p>The user must have registered and/ or signed into an account.</p>
        <p>Postconditions:</p>
        <p>
          The user will now have access to the manage team panel and be able to
          draft a fantasy team. The user will also have access to the leave
          league button.
        </p>
        <h4>Manage Team</h4>
        <p>
          **note: This panel should also be where the user is able to see data
          about points that have been scored for their team. This is also where
          they can see other data like points scored by individual players and
          how the user has gained the majority of their points over the season.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user will be able to select players from the LCS to play in their
          fantasy team.
        </p>
        <p>Basic Flow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The use case starts when the user has activated the manage team
            panel.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system will present what data it has on the user's fantasy team.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system will display a button to allow the user to make
            substitiutions to their roster.
          </li>
          <li>The user will request to make changes.</li>
          <li>
            The system will create the player pool component which the user can
            then access.
          </li>
          <li>
            The user will make changes to their team via their roster component
            or player pool component.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system checks that the requests are inline with league rules and
            serves the changes.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternative Flow:</p>
        <p>
          Step 7. If the request fails to pass all the system checks a message
          will be displayed to the user and the use case will go back to step 6.
        </p>
        <p>Preconditions:</p>
        <p>The user must have registered and/ or signed into an account.</p>
        <p>Postconditions:</p>
        <p>
          The access the user has to making changes to their fantasy team will
          be affected depending on the changes they made. Such access limiations
          will be enforced until the end of the week.
        </p>
        <h4>Leave League</h4>
        <p>
          The user will be able to click a button and request to leave the
          league.
        </p>
        <p>Basic Flow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The use case starts when the user indicats that they want to leave
            the fantasy league and disband their team.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system will display a message and confirm with the user that
            they wish to carry out this action.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system will then make changes to the league and delete data
            relating to the user's fantasy team.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternative Flow:</p>
        <p>
          Step 2. If the user decides not to confirm the action the use case
          will end.
